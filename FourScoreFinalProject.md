# NBA Championship Data

## Description/Purpose
  The purpose of this project was to create a database using NBA Championship Finals Data back to 1980. Data loaded into our initial database was gathered from Kaggle which included every champion, and a number of stats for each game played in the championship per year. Based on this data, we decided to extract data from a second dataset by migrating a web csv without actually downloading the content. The additional data contains details on players that have played on all teams for each year. From there, we will pull players from the web csv into our championship data to pair player information for each winning team.
